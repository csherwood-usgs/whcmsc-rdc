The calculations in this Python Jupyter notebook investigate solutions to a multi-step reaction model describing the successive dechlorination of DDE to DDMU and finally DDNU, as discussed in Eganhouse and Pontolillo (2008) and Eganhouse et al. (in review). The calculations produce Figures 7 and S-9 in the draft manuscript.

## Batemen
The name of the notebooks refers to Harry Bateman, FRS, who provided analtical solutions for radioctive decay. The analytical solutions were not used here because they are undefined when two of the rate constants are identical.
