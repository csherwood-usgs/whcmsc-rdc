The calculations in this Python Jupyter notebook investigate solutions to a multi-step reaction model describing the successive dechlorination of DDE to DDMU and finally DDNU, as discussed in Eganhouse and Pontolillo (2008) and Eganhouse et al. (in review). The calculations produce Figure 7 in the draft manuscript.

## Batemen?
The name of the notebooks refers to Harry Bateman, FRS, who provided analtical solutions for radioctive decay.
